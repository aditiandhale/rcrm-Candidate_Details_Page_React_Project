Project Documentation: Candidate Details Page 

Project Overview 

The project involved developing a Candidate Details Page for a recruitment agency web 
application based on a provided Figma wireframe. The goal was to create a responsive, 
interactive, and visually appealing UI while maintaining a clean and extensible codebase. 

Approach & Methodology 
1. UI Development - Designed the layout strictly based on the provided wireframe.
2. Focused on creating a clean and modern UI using HTML, Vanilla CSS, and React.
3. Implemented responsive design to ensure compatibility across devices. 
4. State Management - Used React Context API for global state management.
5. Stored candidate data in a mock API (JSON file) and fetched it to simulate real API calls. 
6. Edit Functionality - Developed an edit candidate details modal. - Implemented dynamic updates using context state instead of local component variables. - Ensured that changes are reflected immediately on the candidate details page. 
7. Icons & Styling - Integrated Boxicons for all icons used in the project.
8. Created reusable CSS classes and SCSS for better maintainability. 
Technologies Used - React.js (for UI and state management) - HTML5 (structure) - Vanilla CSS / SCSS (styling) - React Context API (state management) - Mock API (JSON) (data storage) - Boxicons (icons library)

Key Features Developed - 
Candidate Information Display
- Displays candidate personal, professional, and contact details.
- Edit Candidate Details 
- Modal-based edit form for updating candidate information.
- Responsive Design - Optimized for desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
- Tab Navigation - Implemented tabs as per the wireframe for better content organization.

Challenges Faced 
1. Wireframe-to-UI Accuracy - Ensuring pixel-perfect alignment with the Figma wireframe. 
2. State Management - Managing candidate data updates across multiple components. 
3. Responsive Design Issues - Handling different screen sizes without using any CSS frameworks. 
4. Edit Functionality Synchronization - Making sure edited data updates immediately in the UI without refreshing.
   
Solutions Implemented - 
- Used flexbox and grid layouts for precise UI alignment. 
- Managed data globally using React Context API for seamless updates.
- Wrote custom media queries to ensure responsiveness.
- Used controlled components in the edit modal to synchronize data. 

Conclusion & Future Enhancements 
The project successfully meets the given requirements and closely follows the provided wireframe. 
The UI is clean, responsive, and user-friendly. 

Future improvements could include: 
- Integrating a real backend API instead of mock JSON.
- Implementing form validation for better user input handling.
- Adding unit tests to improve code quality and maintainability.
